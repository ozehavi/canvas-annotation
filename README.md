# Canvas Annotations Project

This project is a small web application designed for annotating doors and windows on a floor plan image. It provides functionality to create, view, and manage annotations on a canvas.

## Features

1. Annotate elements with bounding boxes (rectangles) on the canvas.
2. Display all annotations directly on the canvas.
3. Assign a name to each annotation.
4. View a table next to the canvas that lists annotation names and their coordinates.
5. Rename & delete annotations
6. Created annotations are saved to the local storage

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm run start
```
This command runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.
